# Demivim
My personal configuration for NVIM. 

## Quick setup: 
A git pull into `.config` for macOS/linux 

Add to `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file: 
`alias dvim='NVIM_APPNAME=demivim nvim'` 

## Yet to configure: 
- [ ] Neotree, remaps and config 
- [ ] start screen, colors and options 
- [ ] formatter, primarily prettier for work and cpp formatter
- [ ] more and more remaps 

## Lower priority 
- [ ] debugger 
- [ ] install scripts to ship as a package 
- [ ] anything windows related ( I have yet to even install nvim on wandows)
